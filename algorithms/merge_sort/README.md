https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Merge_sort

> The   merge sort   is a recursive sort of order   n*log(n).

> It is notable for having a worst case and average complexity of O(n*log(n)), and a best case complexity of O(n) (for pre-sorted input).

> The basic idea is to split the collection into smaller groups by halving it until the groups only have one element or no elements (which are both entirely sorted groups).
